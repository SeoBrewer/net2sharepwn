Net2SharePwn is an utility to check and exploit automatically the NetBIOS/CIFS/SMB Network Shares available from network access points.

Question: How do you identify THE FILE containing a password to elevate your network or system privileges, when too much domains or IP addresses are present ? The time is an important factor in this situation … and during penetration testing, it’s common to identify a VBS script stored in a Windows network share and embedding a domain administrator account password. Answer: Net2SharePwn? has been built to allow that.

Net2SharePwn is built in Python (tested on Python2.7) and can be launched only on Linux (tested on Backtrack) and Mac OS x platforms.

I apologize for Python coding, it doesn’t respect the best practices but I didn’t predict to publish Net2SharePwn … Net2SharePwn is perhaps developed “with my feet” (developed to learn python) but it is functional.
